    "# Considerations\n",
    "* After Kf and Ks were closed, the passive properties would take the membrane to resting membrane potential, and therefore influence AHP duration.\n",
    "* This parametrization had to be done in conjunction with the 2nd step.\n",
    "* In the current strategy, decreasing $\\alpha_q$ causes more adaptation, but changes AHP peak and duration. Adjusting Ks conductance and $\\beta_q$ in order to get back a proper AHP will make the adaptation obtained disappear.\n",
    "* The FxI curve was close to what is described in literature, but the adaptation period, which is known to be longer for higher currents, was always shorter."
